# Wunderground PWS Widget for KDE 6

A Plasma 6 widget for showing weather from Wunderground Personal Weather Stations (PWS).

![image showing main widget face](./examples/main.png)

PWS is a network of [250,000+](https://www.wunderground.com/pws/overview) weather stations that offer local and timely weather conditions. Rather than traditional sources which average data across areas, you can know exactly what the conditions are within a small (many times less than 1km) radius. Furthermore, the stations offer more timely (every 5 minutes) reporting than most sources. This widget includes those local conditions as well as forecasts, alerts, air quality, and additional info for your area.

## Installing

Install at the [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/p/2135799) or your distribution's package manager if it carries plasma widgets (ie. [Discover](https://apps.kde.org/discover/)[^1]).

## Configuring

This widget relies on local stations (ie. [KGADACUL1](https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/KGADACUL1)). You can get an overview of stations in your area at [`wunderground.com/wundermap`](https://wunderground.com/wundermap). Do not worry if you don't know any or you cannot access that site! The widget allows you to search by your area name or coordinates.

Once installed, click `Configure Wunderground` or right-click and hit the slider icon. Then, under `Station`, click `Select from Map`.

### Search by city/area

To search by your address, city, locality, or neighborhood, enter that name into the first search box next to the `Search` button. Then, click `Search`. Next, choose the full name of your area with the dropdown box next to the `Choose` button. Click `Choose`. Select a station from the map and hit `âœ“Confirm`. Due to API restrictions, this must be split into two parts.

### Removing Stations

## Meta

Big thanks to [@bluxart](https://x.com/bluxart) and [@pyconic](https://x.com/pyconic) for Meteocons the free [icons](https://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/).

Big thanks to [Zren](https://github.com/Zren) for files from [`applet-lib`](https://github.com/Zren/plasma-applet-lib/) and [`applet-simpleweather`](https://github.com/Zren/plasma-applet-simpleweather/).

Upstream changes have also been merged back in from rliwoch's [`plasmoid-wunderground-extended`](https://github.com/rliwoch/plasmoid-wunderground-extended).

Portions of [CompactRepresentation](./plasmoid/contents/ui/CompactRepresentation.qml) and [IconAndTextItem](./plasmoid/contents/ui/IconAndTextItem.qml) are from `org.kde.plasma.weather`.

The text coloring utilities are thanks to @Gojir4 on the QML forum.

### Known Problems

Qt 6.10: Widget version 3.5.3 is required.

Text coloring for dark/transparent themes is currently buggy in Plasma 6. The first time a widget loads the text may not be colored correctly.

Changing the transparency then back again seems to solve this issue. See [#58](https://github.com/k-donn/plasmoid-wunderground/issues/58).
Under Appearance in the widget settings, toggle "Show Background."

The legacy forecast API is geolocation locked in some cases. The newer API is not, but it does not provide all of the same attributes. Checking `Use Legacy Forecast API:` under `Debug` in settings reverts the widget to use the legacy API. Then, you then get the snow, thunder, and golf forecast.

If you are getting lots of `Setting initial properties failed: <COMPONENT> does not have a property called cfg_XXXX` that is a known [Plasma bug](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=494417) and does not affect the widget.
